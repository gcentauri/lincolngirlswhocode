* Lincoln Girls Who Code
resources, notes, ideas, code for the lincoln girls who code club!

*** Welcome!
This is our Github space, lets create this together!  A few notes on
markup:

* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    Write stuff here!
*** 3rd level
    more text
     
* Another top level headline

You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= andd ~code~, 
and, if you must, ‘+strike-through+’. Text in the code and verbatim string 
is not processed for Org mode specific syntax, it is exported verbatim.
