# Lincoln Girls Who Code
resources, notes, ideas, code for the lincoln girls who code club!

### Welcome!
This is our Github space, lets create this together!  A few notes on
markup:

```Making words **bold** or *italic* lets you emphasize stuff.```

A numbered list of why this club is aweseome:

    1. because girls are awesome
    2. coding is like being a wizard?(something better)
    3. making stuff ourselves and sharing knowledge is radical!

thats actually four things, but...

a different kind of list doesnt make numbers:

    * lists seem to be everywhere
    * lists are good
    * lists are life
      * really?

There's a lot more you can do with MarkDown, [github even tells you about it](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

p.s. I guess it [supports emoji](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) ```:stuck_out_tongue:``` :stuck_out_tongue:

## What Are We Doing Here?

Learning, teaching, coding.

Its all the same thing, really.

I would like this to be a sort of "monorepo" of "literate programs".
Thats just fancy words to say this place is like a big pile of files 
we can all share to write code with, and *for*, each other.

This means that people from all skill levels can collaborate,
some of the work here might be from adult programmers, some from kid students,
some from kid programmers, and some from adult students!  Remember, being a coder
is the same as being a learner and teacher.

Even though code is written to tell computers to do things, we are really
writing code that we'd like other humans to read, so they can learn and code and help us!
