* Home
 
I like the idea of having a home base in a project.  I don't know the best way
to really use it, but regardless, I like it.  I'm writing this in org mode
because it allows me the possibilty of writing literate code.  What does this
mean?  It means I can write a program like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket :tangle hello_world.rkt
;; this will be a comment in the racket file
;; in racket, we can simply write a String, this is a complete program!
"hello world!"
#+END_SRC

And then I can use Emacs to 'tangle' the code file out of this document.

You should see a file hello_world.rkt in this repo.

One great thing about org files, is that github can translate them just like
markdown files?

** Image test
#+BEGIN_SRC racket :tangle image-test.rkt
  #lang racket
  (require 2htdp/image)

  (define (block color)
    (square 50 'solid color))

  (define (ball color)
    (circle 25 'solid color))

  (define (tri color)
    (triangle 50 'solid color))

  (define rainbow (list 'red 'orange 'yellow 'green 'blue 'indigo 'violet))

  (define (chain-of-shapes shape list-of-colors)
    (cond
      [(empty? list-of-colors) empty-image]
      [else (beside (shape (first list-of-colors))
                    (chain-of-shapes shape (rest list-of-colors)))]))
#+END_SRC
