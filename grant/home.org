* Home

I like the idea of having a home base in a project.  I don't know the best way
to really use it, but regardless, I like it.  I'm writing this in org mode
because it allows me the possibilty of writing literate code.  What does this
mean?  It means I can write a program like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket :tangle hello_world.rkt
;; this will be a comment in the racket file
;; in racket, we can simply write a String, this is a complete program!
"hello world!"
#+END_SRC

And then I can use Emacs to 'tangle' the code file out of this document.

You should see a file hello_world.rkt in this repo.
